This project was created as a supplemental application material for a Design Engineer role at LinkedIn.

Linkma is a Figma plugin that generates editable, prototypable Figma components using a combination of design tokens, component instances, markup, and JavaScript. Linkma is meant to expedite internal workflows for UX, Product Design, Design Systems, or similar teams.

The plugin currently generates LinkedIn Post components.
